# Curve Grant Breakdown

## **Scope of Work, Milestones, Grant Allocation**

We propose to divide the grant into three milestones, corresponding to the complexity and novelty of the project. We are asking for initial funds for Phase 1 to get us started focusing 100%. Upon successful completion of Phase 1, we intend to discuss further phases and the corresponding funding requirements with Curve. Therefore, Milestones 2&3 are yet subject to change, depending on the alignment with the curve team, after completion of Milestone 1.

### **Milestone 1: Research & Proof-of-Concept**

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month
- **FTE:** 3 (*FTE = Full Time Equivalent)
- **Costs:** $15,000
- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th August 2023

This phase will focus on in-depth research and the creation of proof-of-concepts demonstrating how tailored firewall can enhance the security and functionality of Curve.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and examples that explain how on-chain security methods, mainly firewalls could be integrated to the Curve Protocol. All technical components needed to realise this, will be explained. The documentation will also include the detailed research findings that address; → technical limitations, → potential risks, → benefits, → different technical and non-technical implications for Curve Furthermore, we will analyse all implications on gas efficiency  |
| 2. | Proof-of-Concepts | Based on examples that result from the conducted research, functional prototypes will be build proving its technical feasibility. This proof-of-concepts also serve for demonstration purposes to the Curve and its stakeholders, so they have more material to evaluate the further future of this Grant. |
| 3. | Technical Blog Post | A technical blogpost explaining the proof-of-concept and research findings |

### Milestone 2: Prototyping & Production (subject to change)

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 Months
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** $30,000
- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th October 2023

The second phase will concentrate on the development and testing of Firewall prototypes based on the findings of the first phase. The prototypes will showcase the practicality and benefits of integrating on-chain firewalls into the Curve protocol.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Smart Contracts | Development and testing of smart contracts to facilitate Firewall functionalities. |
| 2. | Subgraph(s) | Gather data relevant to Firewall functionalities and Curve stakeholders. → relevant for voters and governance overall |
| 3. | Frontend (if needed) | → Dashboard: ◦ security monitoring & analytics; ◦ UI Components, displaying relevant Data; ◦ UX improvements, seamlessly integrating new functionality to the existing interface (if given), → Dashboard, displaying subgraph data relevant to Curve stakeholders, → Governance Interface; ◦ for handling proposals in emergency situations, such as firewall events |

Our team will also assist in marketing and explaining the integration, including:

- Public blog post and co-marketing.
- Detailed technical explanation of firewall architecture.
- Detailed analysis of security guarantees.

### Milestone 3: Testnet Deployment (subject to change)

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** $15,000
- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th November 2023

The final phase will involve the testnet deployment of all Firewall components, followed by rigorous testing and refinement to ensure the system is ready for mainnet audit and potential integration into Curve.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Testing Guide | All code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 95%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests |
| 2. | Public and clearly documented open-source repos for: → Smart Contracts, → Subgraph(s), → Frontend (if needed) | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up the application. Application is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality of Firewall & governance functionalities, work. |
| 3. | Testnet deployments | all |
| 4. | Informational Publications | → Blog Posts, etc. |
| 5. | Audits | → Auditing the Core Infrastructure |

Our team will also assist in preparing the system for mainnet deployment, including:

- Coordination with Curve for all relevant security audits
- Operating and maintaining relevant components such as the frontend and governance interface
- Providing an open-source implementation for backup
